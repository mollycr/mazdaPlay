Games:

1. Race - Laps around the board. Uses two color sensors, one in each lane, to track lap times, as well as order of finishers. Usable for 1, 3, or 5 laps.
2. Scavenger hunt - App will display and announce (randomized) name of the building players must go to. The first car detected by the active color sensor is the winner.- Building list: Home, Gas Station, School, Grocery Store, Hospital, Library, 	Park, Post office, Police Dept., Bank
3. Story Mode - The player(s) will be given a task prompted by the app. To continue with the story, a player must make it to the active color sensor. Some tasks may be timed. Each task will be associated with a specific building.
4. Free Play - All building color sensors are active, the player(s) are able to do anything they'd like, however, when at a building, app will make the appropriate corresponding sounds or other interactive display.
