Games:

1. Race
- Laps around the board. Uses two color sensors, one in each lane, to track lap times, as well as order of finishers. Usable for 1, 3, or 5 laps.
2. Scavenger hunt
- App will display and announce (randomized) name of the building players must go to. The first car detected by the active color sensor is the winner.

3. Story Mode
- The player(s) will be given a task prompted by the app. To continue with the story, a player must make it to the active color sensor. Some tasks may be timed. Each task will be associated with a specific building.
4. Free Play
